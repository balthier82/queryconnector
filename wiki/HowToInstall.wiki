How to Install the extension on LibreOffice or OpenOffice installation.

= Details =

*On Any Platform:*

 # Go to _Tools -> Extension Manager_ <br>
 # Click on *Add...* <br>
 # Select *queryconnector.oxt* <br>
 # Accept the prompted license <br>
 # Restart OpenOffice/LibreOffice
 # Enjoy! :D

*On Ubuntu with LibreOffice installed via apt-get:*

 # Make sure that the package *libreoffice-java-common* is installed, otherwise the extension will not be registered properly.

*Instructions for use unixODBC:*

 # There is a bug due to the fact that the libraries "libodbc.so" and "libodbcinst.so" libJdbcOdbc.so are not loaded from the library that implements the JDBC-ODBC bridge. After some research I found that you have to set the LD_PRELOAD environment variable this way:

   <code language="bash">export LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD:/usr/lib/libodbc.so:/usr/lib/libodbcinst.so</code>

  assuming that the two files are located in / usr / lib. Without this setting OpenOffice / LibreOffice will crash.
