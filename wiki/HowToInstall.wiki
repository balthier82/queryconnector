*On Any Platform:*

 # Accept the prompted license <br>

===Instructions for use unixODBC:===

 * There is a bug due to the fact that the libraries "libodbc.so" and "libodbcinst.so" are not loaded from the libJdbcOdbc.so library (that implements the JDBC-ODBC bridge). After some research I found that you have to set the LD_PRELOAD environment variable this way:

   <code language="bash">export LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD:/usr/lib/libodbc.so:/usr/lib/libodbcinst.so</code>

   assuming that the two files are located in /usr/lib. Without this setting OpenOffice/LibreOffice will crash.

 * Another problem I found is that the library libJdbcOdbc.so not find libjvm.so library. To solve it we have to change the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable in this way:

   <code language="bash">export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/java/default/lib/i386/client</code>

 * If there is an error called *Invalid Handle* using the ODBC driver libmyodbc.so for MySQL, the problem is not the extension, but the driver itself. Other drivers are working properly.
